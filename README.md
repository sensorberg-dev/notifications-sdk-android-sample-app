This sample app demonstrates a complete implementation for the Sensorberg Notifications SDK  
https://github.com/sensorberg-dev/notifications-sdk-android

### Setup

For easier of manual testing the base URL and API key are setup on the first time init.

The base URL and API key can also be added to the local.properties or enviroment variables.
Example `local.properties`:
```
NOTIFICATIONS_SDK_BASE_URL=https://portal.sensorberg-cdn.com
NOTIFICATIONS_SDK_API_KEY=<api key for the campaign>
```
